## Ideas and Goals

The idea behind this game was to create a simple game that can be played with one hand and will not require much time to solve problems. It should be easy to start, easy to progress and fun.

## Mechanics

Catching light bubbles is the main goal, they fly into the circle area located in the center of the screen as well as black bubbles. When dark circles rich the center area all collected light circles disappear. 

To filter which bubbles should be catched, you have a controlled blue arc that changes from level to level. To rotate the arc press on any point of this arc and drag it. Some levels have bulletproof arc but on some levels it can be damaged. The game also increases difficulty from level to level. In between games there will be characters telling their stories.

## Story

Decision to have story was made because the game felt like it had no soul. Simple bubbles, arc, all this action didn't make sense without introducing some reason.  

Have you ever thought what would be if characters from adventure knew about us, about our way of life. In this game bird and chameleon explore their world and meet other characters that are doing selfies, have blogs or do business.

## Things to Mention

Since game started many new ideas have been added:
- A shop with bonuses, where player can buy some magic that will help to pass some levels.
- Ability to replay levels from a dedicated to levels dashboard.
- Added new mechanics that bring more challanges to gameplay, i.e. fixed movement that player can do with an arc, game timer, arc damages etc.
